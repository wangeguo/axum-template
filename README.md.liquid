## Installation

Prebuilt binaries Windows, Linux and macOS can be downloaded from the
[Github release page](https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{project-name}}/releases/latest).
If there is no distro package available in your preferred manager,
you need [Rust and cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to build it.

### Install from source:

1. Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{project-name}}.git`
2. From the `{{project-name}}` directory, run `cargo build --release` to
   build the application in release mode.
3. After a successful compilation, launch the executable with:
   `target/release/{{project-name}}`.

### Install with cargo

To get the latest bug fixes and features, you can install the development
version from git. However, this is not fully tested. That means you're probably
going to have more bugs despite having the latest bug fixes.

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/{{owner}}/{{project-name}}
```

This will download the source from the main branch, build and install it in
Cargo's global binary directory (`~/.cargo/bin/` by default).
